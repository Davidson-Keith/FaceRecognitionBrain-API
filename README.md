# FaceRecognitionBrain-Api

### This project is from the Udemy course: <br>

The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery <br>
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery

It is a project working along with the course.<br>

This facerecognitionbrain-api is the backend API and server for the
[facerecognitionbrain](https://github.com/Davidson-Keith/FaceRecognitionBrain) front-end repo.

### To see it running:<br>

https://Davidson-Keith.github.io/FaceRecognitionBrain/

The front-end is running on Github Pages.<br>
The back-end and database servers are running on Heroku. <br>
Heroku, incidentally, hosts the database on AWS.

## Outstanding Issues TODO

The course did not include any validation of forms. Neither validation of complete and correctly formatted values, nor
presentation of an error message for an invalid login.

The CSS used doesn't work 100% as expected on all platforms, e.g. iOS.

There is no support for uploading an image, the image must be supplied as a URL by the user.
